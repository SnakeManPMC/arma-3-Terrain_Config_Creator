# arma-3-Terrain_Config_Creator

GUI dialog to help create brand new ArmA 3 terrain config.cpp with basic required values.

Often times newbie terrain makers struggle to get their config.cpp written properly, this tool will make it really easy.

This tool requires user to input namespace and addon tag which are essential for proper addon making so we avoid conflicts with addons made by other addon makers.

This tool should be a web page instead, but hey who doesnt love some C++ hehe.
